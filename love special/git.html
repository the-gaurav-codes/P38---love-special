				Love for you is a journey of discovery and growth. Every moment with you feels like a precious gift, and I cherish the way we laugh, share, and support each other through life's ups and downs. Your smile brightens my darkest days, and your presence brings a sense of peace and warmth that words cannot fully capture. I admire your strength, your kindness, and the way you effortlessly make the world a better place just by being in it. You inspire me to be the best version of myself, and I am endlessly grateful for the love we share. Our bond is my greatest treasure, and I am excited for all the adventures and memories that await us. With you, I've found a love that is pure, genuine, and unwavering, and I am committed to nurturing and cherishing this beautiful connection for all the days to come.

			Love,
          	<br>Nikhil
